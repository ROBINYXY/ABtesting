# A marketing project of Perceptual mapping using Lift technique
This is a project that compares how brands in beauty industry are perceived as similar or different from each other
In perceptual map, the closer they are to each other in distance, the closer they are to each other, the furtherer they are to each other, the more different they are to each other

We're using a technique called lift here. In general, it is easier to compare data with the same scale. Lifting, by comparing probability rather than absolute values, can normalize data and thus transform the data into the same scale.

From the final result, we reach the conclusion of below:
When brands compete by differentiating themselves to tap niche market, theyâ€™re not necessarily competitors. Therefore, we should choose brands from a specific subcategory where competition is high.
